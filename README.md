Real Estate Implementation is a project that is an implementation of an ERC721 token to provide titles for houses. The tokens are minted on the OpenSeas marketplace and can be bought and sold there. The project has a zero-knowledge proof ZoKrates implementation which requires the user to know the proof before minting houses. 

Flight Insurance is a complex project that is for flight insurance if your flight is delayed. Passengers, airlines, and flights will be registered through the application contract which then stores in the information in the data contract. In order for an airline to begin registering flights they need to be vouched for by the majority of airlines registered. Once a passenger has purchased flight insurance, multiple Oracles will provide information on the status of the flight, once enough Oracles have confirmed the status, the passenger is transferred his insurance amount.
