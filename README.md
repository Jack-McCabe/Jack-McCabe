- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jack-McCabe a Blockchain enthusaist and Product Manager who enjoys coding, learning about cool programming hacks and taking coding classes. 

If you are looking at my work I would suggest Real Estate Implementation using ZoKrates and Flight Insurance projects, both part of the Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree, https://confirm.udacity.com/PAXH9PLG.

Real Estate Implementation is a project that is an implementation of an ERC721 token to provide title for houses. The tokens are minted on the OpenSeas marketplace and can be bought and sold there. The project has a zero knowledge proof ZoKrates implementation which requires the user to know the proof before minting houses. 


Flight Insurance is a complex project that is for flight insurance if your flight is delayed. Passengers, airlines and flights will be registered through the application contract which then stores in the information in the data contract. In order for an airline to begin registering flights they need to be vouched for by the majority of airlines registered. Once a passenger has purchased flight insurance, mutliple Oracles will provided information on the status of the flight, once enough have Oracles have confirmed the status, the passenger is transfered his insurance amount. 


Association Analysis using ECLAT, a basic assoscaiton analysis on supply chain lead times. Was a program I developed to build off of my NC State data science course.
